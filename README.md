## üö® **Breaking Changes in v0.2.4** üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Output Format Changed for Trip Operations**

Starting from v0.2.4, the **Trip output format has been significantly changed** to improve workflow design:

### **Before (v0.2.3 and earlier) - JOIN Output:**
Multiple formats were output as **separate items**:
```
Item 1: {"trip": {...}, "analysis": {...}, "output_format": "data"}
Item 2: {"trip_id": 123, "fileName": "trip.kml", "output_format": "kml"} + binary data
Item 3: {"trip_id": 123, "fileName": "trip.gpx", "output_format": "gpx"} + binary data
```

### **After (v0.2.4+) - MERGED Output:**
Multiple formats are **combined into a single item**:
```json
{
  "formats": ["rawData", "geojson", "kml"],
  "analysis": {...},
  "rawData": {...},
  "geojson": {...},
  "kml": {"fileName": "trip.kml", "mimeType": "..."}
}
```

**üîß Migration Required:** Update your workflows to access data via:
- Raw trip data: `json.rawData` (renamed from `json.data`)
- GeoJSON data: `json.geojson` (NEW format)
- Binary files: `binary["filename"]`

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Ride with GPS in your n8n workflows.

Ride with GPS is a comprehensive cycling platform that allows users to plan routes, track rides, organize events, and share their cycling adventures with a community of riders.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Operations

This node supports the following resources and operations:

### User

- **Get Current**: Retrieve information about the currently authenticated user

### Events

- **Get Event**: Retrieve details of a specific event by ID (including associated routes and organizer info)
- **Get Events**: Retrieve a paginated list of events owned by the authenticated user

### Routes

- **Get Route**: Retrieve details of a specific route by ID (including track points, course points, and points of interest)
- **Get Routes**: Retrieve a paginated list of routes owned by the authenticated user

### Trips

- **Get Trip**: Retrieve details of a specific trip by ID (including track points and comprehensive trip statistics)
  - **Multiple Output Formats**: Choose from Data, KML, GPX, and Image formats (multiple selections allowed)
  - **Image Generation**: Create static map images using Google Maps Static API (optional feature)
- **Get Trips**: Retrieve a paginated list of trips owned by the authenticated user

### Sync

- **Sync**: Retrieve changes to routes and/or trips since a specific datetime (specialized for data synchronization)

### Analysis

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Under Development**: Analysis features are currently in development and should not be used in production workflows

## Credentials

To use this node, you need to authenticate with Ride with GPS using your service account credentials.

### Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Ride with GPS account](https://ridewithgps.com)

### Authentication Setup

1. In n8n, create new credentials of type "Ride API"
2. Enter your Ride with GPS service account email address and password
3. **Optional**: Enter your Google Maps API key for static map image generation
   - This is only required if you want to use the Image output format for trips
   - You can use all other features without a Google Maps API key
4. Configure the base URL (defaults to `https://ridewithgps.com`)

### Google Maps API Setup (Optional)

To use the static map image generation feature:

1. Get a Google Maps API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the "Maps Static API" for your project
3. Add the API key to your Ride API credentials in n8n
4. **Note**: This is completely optional - all other node features work without it

## Compatibility

- **Minimum n8n version**: 1.0.0
- **Node.js version**: 20.15 or higher
- **Tested with**: n8n v1.x

## Usage

### Basic Examples

**Get Current User Information:**

- Select Resource: User
- The node will automatically fetch the current user's profile information

**List Your Routes:**

- Select Resource: Routes
- Select Operation: Get Routes
- Optionally specify a page number for pagination

**Get Specific Route Details:**

- Select Resource: Routes
- Select Operation: Get Route
- Enter the Route ID

**Get Trip with Multiple Output Formats:**

- Select Resource: Trips
- Select Operation: Get Trip
- Enter the Trip ID
- Select Output Formats: Choose any combination of Data, KML, GPX, and/or Image
- **Image Format**: Creates a static map showing the trip route with start/end markers
  - Requires Google Maps API key in credentials
  - Generates n8n-compatible binary data for easy use with other nodes

![Static Map Example](docs/StaticMap.png)
_Example of generated static map showing trip route with start (S) and end (E) markers_

**Sync Changes:**

- Select Resource: Sync
- Enter a "Since Datetime" in ISO8601 format (e.g., `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`)
- Select Asset Types (Routes, Trips, or both)
- This is useful for maintaining synchronized copies of user data

### Pagination

Most list operations support pagination through the "Page Number" parameter. The response will include metadata about pagination, including total record count and links to additional pages.

### Data Synchronization

The Sync operation is particularly useful for:

- Initial full synchronization (use `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` as since datetime)
- Incremental updates (use the timestamp from previous sync)
- Maintaining backup copies of user's route and trip libraries

## Changelog
